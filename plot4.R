#Relevant Question (Question 4)
#Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources 
#changed from 1999â€“2008?

#Get all the sources connected to Coal subsetting SCC
#subsetting is done looking for the "Coal" keyword in the source Short.Name
SCC_coal <- SCC[grep("Coal", SCC$Short.Name),] #230 sources related to Coal

#Get all of the data connected to source related to coal
NEI_coal <- NEI[which(NEI$SCC %in% SCC_coal$SCC),]

#Aggregate the SUM of emissions by Year
NEI_coal_aggregate <- aggregate(NEI_coal$Emissions, list(Year = NEI_coal$year), sum)
names(NEI_coal_aggregate) <- c("Year", "TotalEmissions")

#Scaling down values by 1000 - Total Emission is in 1000 ton now
NEI_coal_aggregate$TotalEmissions <- NEI_coal_aggregate$TotalEmissions / 1000

#Being a simple plot - Use the base plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

#Answer
#The total emission of PM2.5 (coal-combustion sources) across the United States has decreased 
#from 596.6879 x 1000 ton (1999) to 355.9677 x 1000 ton (2008)
